          <h1>Antler - An IRL Browser</h1>
        </header>
        <div class="blog-body">
          <p>Hey! I launched an app called <a href="https://antlerbrowser.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Antler</a>. </p>
<p>Antler started as a simple idea: A local internet just for my neighbourhood. However, the idea morphed into something a bit more practical: an open-source tool that helps developers build lightweight apps when <strong>you know your users will be at a specific location.</strong></p>
<p>Here is a demo of Antler in action, I scan a QR code and immediately get checked into my co-working space.</p>
<p><video src="https://ax0.taddy.org/dmathewwws/antler-demo.mp4" controls width="100%" autoplay muted loop></video></p>
<p>However, that checkin app is just one example of a lightweight mini app, any developer can build their own mini app. For example, <a href="https://drawing.dmathewwws.com">draw-on-my-phone</a> is a game where a group of friends scan a QR code to enter a game room and take turns drawing on each other&#39;s phones (similar to Telestrations or Garlic Phone)</p>
<p>In both cases, a user scans a QR code and instantly gets logged in. Moreover, no servers were needed to make this happen.</p>
<p>Antler is an iOS or Android app that users download. However, what makes Antler interesting is that it uses an open-specification called the <a href="https://antlerbrowser.com/open-specification" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IRL Browser Specification</a>. This spec is an attempt to answer the question: <strong>Can we build a mini app platform on open web standards?</strong></p>
<p>In a future where this specification is adopted, you can scan a QR at a coffee shop, concert, or conference → You instantly access the experience. No downloads. No signups. </p>
<h2>WeChat Mini Apps</h2>
<p>Currently, there are developer platforms that make it easier for developers to build lightweight mini apps:</p>
<ul>
<li>WeChat Mini Apps</li>
<li>WhatsApp Business / WhatsApp Business API</li>
<li>iOS App Clips</li>
</ul>
<p>What makes it easier to build on these platforms is they take care of auth, payments and help make it easier to host or distribute of your app. </p>
<p>Let&#39;s focus on WeChat. You might know it as a popular messaging app in China similar to WhatsApp or Telegram. But it&#39;s also called a super app because of all the useful mini apps you can use inside it. </p>
<p>For example, if you wanted to rent a bike in Shanghai, just open WeChat and scan the QR code on a bike to unlock and start riding. Under the hood, the bike share company’s mini app gets downloaded and runs inside WeChat, your WeChat id is used for registration/verification with the bike sharing app and WeChat pay is used for payment after the ride is complete.</p>
<p><img src="https://ax0.taddy.org/dmathewwws/wechat-bike-share.png" alt="wechat-bike-share.png"></p>
<p>WeChat Mini apps proved out a really important use case in the Chinese market: You don’t always need a native app. Sometimes the better experience is to just scan a QR code.</p>
<h2>How Antler Works</h2>
<p>Antler’s goal is to give the same great UX experience from WeChat mini apps, using regular QR codes + open web standards + an open specification used for communication. What makes Antler unique to WeChat is there is no central Antler server that is used for auth. This is how it works:</p>
<p><img src="https://ax0.taddy.org/dmathewwws/antler-how-it-works.png" alt="antler-how-it-works.png"></p>
<p>When a user downloads Antler, they create a profile that is stored locally on their device.</p>
<p>A profile contains: </p>
<ul>
<li>a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-1.0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DID</a> (a W3C standard for identity) - a public key</li>
<li>a private key</li>
<li>a name</li>
<li>link to socials (optional)</li>
<li>an avatar (optional)</li>
</ul>
<p>When a user scans a QR code, Antler opens your website inside a WebView and injects a <code>window.irlBrowser</code> object.</p>
<p>The <code>window</code> object is available on all browsers, and as a developer it gives you access to useful browser features. For example, <code>window.location</code> lets you know the current url you are visiting in the browser. We made up a new property called <code>window.irlBrowser</code> and use it as an interface to communicate between the Antler app and your website.</p>
<p>Your website calls <code>window.irlBrowser.getProfileDetails()</code>  and gets back cryptographically signed profile data as a JWT.</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
  &quot;iss&quot;: &quot;did:key:z6MkhaXgBZDvotDkL5257faiztiGiC2QtKLGpbnnEGta2doK&quot;,
  &quot;aud&quot;: &quot;https://yourdomain.com&quot;,
  &quot;iat&quot;: 1728393600,
  &quot;exp&quot;: 1728397200,
  &quot;type&quot;: &quot;irl:profile:details&quot;,
  &quot;data&quot;: 
    {
      &quot;did&quot;: &quot;did:key:z6MkhaXgBZDvotDkL5257faiztiGiC2QtKLGpbnnEGta2doK&quot;,
      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Danny Mathews&quot;,
      &quot;socials&quot;: [{ &quot;platform&quot;: &quot;INSTAGRAM&quot;, &quot;handle&quot;: &quot;dmathewwws&quot; }]
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>You should decode and verify that the public key in the <code>iss</code> field was used to sign this data. This way you know only someone with the private key for this DID could have sent it.</p>
<p>And voila, the user is instantly logged into your website. Profile details that were stored locally on the user’s device are shared to your website and no servers were involved! </p>
<p><img src="https://ax0.taddy.org/dmathewwws/wechat-antler-comparison.png" alt="wechat-antler-comparison.png"></p>
<h2>Open Source</h2>
<p>Antler is <a href="https://github.com/antler-browser/antler" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open-source</a>. It&#39;s a simple React Native app that stores user profiles and public / private key pairs.</p>
<p>Antler uses an <a href="https://antlerbrowser.com/irl-browser-standard.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open specification</a> to pass data between your website and the mobile app. These are the five functions that are defined in the spec.</p>
<pre><code class="language-tsx">interface IRLBrowser {
  // Get profile details (name, socials)
  getProfileDetails(): Promise&lt;string&gt;;
  
  // Get avatar as base64-encoded string
  getAvatar(): Promise&lt;string | null&gt;;
  
  // Get details about the IRL Browser
  getBrowserDetails(): BrowserDetails;
  
  // Request additional permissions (in the future)
  requestPermission(permission: string): Promise&lt;boolean&gt;;
  
  // Close the WebView (return to QR scanner)
  close(): void;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Being an open specification means anyone can create an alternative to Antler. </p>
<p>It also means if you are a developer, and:</p>
<ul>
<li>Want to add instant login via a QR code to your website, you know you are not locked into Antler or a closed platform.</li>
<li>Want to integrate mini apps into your current app. All the mini apps that work with Antler, will work inside your app (just follow the spec).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Do your users have to download an app?</h3>
<p>Your users don’t actually need to download Antler or any mobile app. Here is a client side package <a href="https://github.com/antler-browser/irl-browser-onboarding" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>irl-browser-onboarding</code></a> that you can add to your website that takes advantage of Antler being built on an open specification to create a Temporary / One Time account.</p>
<p>The package checks if your mini app is being viewed inside a IRL Browser, and if not, creates an onboarding flow where a user enters their name, social links, and avatar and injects the same <code>window.irlBrowser</code> API that Antler or any IRL Browser would. This means if users want they can use Antler and get the immediate login UX and a persistent profile, or they can create a one-time / temporary profile if don’t.</p>
<h2>Example Apps</h2>
<p>My hope with IRL Browser mini apps is that it encourages developers like me to build apps that we would have never thought would be feasible to build a native app for ie) building an app for my social clubs, local community events, venues, pop-ups, game nights with friends, or any lightweight gathering where people are physically present.</p>
<p>Here are some example use cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Networking<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/antler-browser/meetup-cloudflare" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Check into event app</a> (Demo: <a href="https://zspace.dmathewwws.com">https://zspace.dmathewwws.com</a>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>IRL Games with friends<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/antler-browser/draw-on-my-phone-game" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Draw on my phone IRL game</a> (Demo: <a href="https://drawing.dmathewwws.com">https://drawing.dmathewwws.com</a>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Business Applications:<ul>
<li>Loyalty Program for a coffee shop (you shouldn’t have to download a different app for every coffee shop)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Interactive Arts Projects</li>
<li>Community Building / Neighbourhood Projects<ul>
<li>ex) Relational Tech Project: <a href="https://relationaltechproject.org/remix" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://relationaltechproject.org/remix</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hopefully even more</li>
</ul>
<h2>Branding</h2>
<p>An interesting idea that came up while building this was to create a visual cue so a user knows if you scan this QR code it offers instant login. Antlers was what I came up with, and it inspired the app&#39;s name.</p>
<p><img src="https://ax0.taddy.org/dmathewwws/antler-branding.png" alt="antler-branding.png"></p>
<h2>Future Roadmap For Antler</h2>
<ul>
<li>Add NFC (doesn&#39;t have to be just QR codes)</li>
<li>Add Incognito Mode</li>
<li>Add more DID Methods, Add Verifiable Credentials.</li>
<li>Pass through more native capabilities to mini apps (with explicit user permission)<ul>
<li>Location</li>
<li>Push Notifications</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://miniapps.farcaster.xyz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Farcaster Mini Apps</a> - Similar concept to WeChat MiniApps but integrated into the Farcaster social network. It implements a similar specification to IRL Browser ie) uses a WebView to communicate with mini apps and their app and mini apps are built with standard HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</p>
<p><a href="https://webxdc.org/docs/get_started.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WebXDC</a> - A similar specification to IRL Browser as well. Focused on chat apps that want to integrate a mini app experience into their chat app. </p>
